# Mapping Earthquakes
## Overview
The objective of this project was to create a dashboard to display earthqauke data based on magnitude, location and relation to tectonic plates. The dashboard consists of three maps and three overlay options. The viewer can select the desired options. 

Screen shots are below for reference.
